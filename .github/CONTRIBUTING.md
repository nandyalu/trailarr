## Code Style

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

- All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more specs (unit tests).
- Your code should follow the syntax style of the existing code (PEP-8 for Python code, formatted using black formatter, and the Angular Style Guide for Angular code).

## Commit Message Guidelines

The commit message:

- is written in the imperative (e.g., "Fix ...", "Add ...")
- is kept short, while concisely explaining what the commit does.
- is clear about what part of the code is affected -- often by prefixing with the name of the subsystem and a colon, like "express: ..." or "docs: ...".
- is a complete sentence, ending with a period.
