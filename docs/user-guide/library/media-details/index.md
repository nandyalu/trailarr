# Media Details

Media Details of an item will be opened in Trailarr UI under URL '/media/{id}' where `{id}` is the media ID in Trailarr.

![Library - Media Details](library-media-details.png)

Media Details view offers some features for managing media items. They are described below:

## Monitor / UnMonitor

<video autoplay loop src="./monitor-toggle.mp4" title="Media - Monitor Toggle"></video>

If a trailer hasn't been downloaded for Media, it can be either Monitored or UnMonitored by clicking the icon before the Media Title.

## Status - Additional Details

<video autoplay loop src="./media-status-additional-details.mp4" title="Media - Status - Additional Details"></video>

Additional Media Status details can be viewed by hovering (click on it in Mobile) on `Status` field.

!!! tip "Season Count for TV Show"
    This will also show a `Season Count` of the selected Media if it's a TV Show. This is coming from `Sonarr` and `Trailarr` can only read it, cannot update it!

## YouTube Trailer ID

![Media - YouTube Trailer ID](media-youtube-trailer-id.png)

This is the YouTube video ID present in Trailarr for this Media item, and can be updated here!

This usually comes from `Radarr` for Movies, however `Sonarr` does not contain any such value so this will initially be empty for `TV Shows`.

### Save YouTube ID

![Media - Save YouTube Trailer ID](media-save-youtube-trailer-id.png)

A save button will appear if `YouTube Trailer ID` value has changed, prompting you to save.

!!! note ""
    Save will only save the `YouTube Trailer ID` in Trailarr, does not download trailer automatically!

### Search YouTube ID

![Media - Search YouTube Trailer ID](media-search-youtube-trailer-id.png)

A search button will appear if `YouTube Trailer ID` is not available for the `Media` in Trailarr.

This can be used to let Trailarr search for a trailer for the `Media` by selecting a `Profile`.

## Files Section

![Media Details - Click to Open Files](media-files-click-to-open.png)

Media Files are not loaded by default, as Trailarr needs to read the files every time - which increases file operations. Just click on the section to open them!

![Media Details - Files](media-files-open.png)

The files and folders available in the media folder will be displayed here, starting with the Media folder itself!

Click on a folder to reveal it's files.

!!! tip ""
    If you don't see your actual Media files here, that means you need to update either your [Volume Mappings](../../../getting-started/02-installation/docker-compose.md#media-folders) or [Path Mappings](../../../getting-started/03-setup/connections.md#2-path-mappings).

Clicking on a file will open a dialog with some actions available that can be performed on the file:
