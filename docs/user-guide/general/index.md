# General

This page explains some of the generic options that are available in the Trailarr UI

## Documentation Search

If you are looking for something, but not sure where to look in the documentation... Search is your friend! You can search with keywords.

## Search Media (`Ctrl + F`)

![General - Search Media](general-search.png)

You can use the search bar at the top to search for any Media item in the Trailarr Library and open it to see it's details.

Search functionality is available on all pages. Search is not case-sensitive meaning `The Matrix` and `the matrix` will return same results!

You can also use Keyboard Shortcut `Ctrl + F` to trigger search. If you want to use browser search, press `Ctrl + F` again!
