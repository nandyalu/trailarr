See Volume Mapping for more information.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>Path mappings are optional and only required if you have a setup that requires them. You can set different path mappings for each Radarr/Sonarr instance.</p> Example <p>Adding a path mapping for a connection as: <pre><code>Path From: C:\\Users\\username\\Movies\nPath To: /media/movies\n</code></pre> will replace <code>C:\\Users\\username\\Movies</code> with <code>/media/movies</code> in the path received from Radarr/Sonarr. So, if Radarr/Sonarr sends a path like <code>C:\\Users\\username\\Movies\\The MAtrix (1999)</code>, it will be replaced with <code>/media/movies/The Matrix (1999)</code>.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Click the <code>Add Path Mapping</code> button. </p> </li> <li> <p>Set the <code>Path From</code> to the path inside Radarr/Sonarr connection.</p> </li> <li> <p>Set the <code>Path To</code> to the path inside the Trailarr container. </p> </li> <li> <p>Click the <code>Save</code> button to save the path mapping.</p> </li> <li> <p>Repeat the steps for each path mapping you want to add, if needed.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Tip</p> <p>Path mappings are useful when the media folder available to Radarr/Sonarr is same for multiple connections. For example, if Radarr has media folder set to <code>/media</code> and Sonarr has media folder set to <code>/media</code>, you can map the local folder for Radarr media to <code>/media/movies</code> and Sonarr media to <code>/media/tv</code> and then in add path mappings with <code>Path From</code> set to <code>/media</code> and <code>Path To</code> set to <code>/media/movies</code> for Radarr and <code>/media/tv</code> for Sonarr connections.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>For Path Mappings to work, you need to set the <code>Path From</code> to the exact path inside Radarr/Sonarr connection and <code>Path To</code> to the exact path inside the Trailarr container.
