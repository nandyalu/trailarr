For example <code>Radarr</code> and <code>Sonarr</code> also uses a <code>/config</code> inside it's container for appdata.</p> <p>If you do not provide this, trailarr will still work, but once you restart your system, it will become an amnesia patient! It will forget everything and you have to start from scratch. We don't want that right! so we need to map this to a folder on our computer/server so that the data exists even on restarting the system.</p> <p>Below are some examples on how you can map this to a folder on your system.

Similary the TV Shows are in <code>/data/tv</code>.</p> <p>So, we can use this in Trailarr:</p> <pre><code>services:\n  trailarr:\n    image: nandyalu/trailarr:latest\n    # Other options here\n    volumes:\n      - /docker/appdata/trailarr:/config\n      - /data:/data\n    # Other options here\n</code></pre> <p>Since <code>Radarr</code> and <code>Sonarr</code> both have the same volume <code>/data:/data</code> we don't need to duplicate it!</p> Example 2 - Different folders for <code>Radarr</code> and <code>Sonarr</code> <p>If you have <code>Radarr</code> and <code>Sonarr</code> like below:</p> <pre><code>services:\n  radarr:\n    image: ghcr.io/hotio/radarr:latest\n    # Other options here\n    volumes:\n      - /docker/appdata/radarr:/config\n      - /mnt/movies_disk/media/movies:/media/movies\n    # Other options here\n  sonarr:\n    image: ghcr.io/hotio/sonarr:latest\n    # Other options here\n    volumes:\n      - /docker/appdata/sonarr:/config\n      - /mnt/series_disk/media/tv:/media/tv\n    # Other options here\n</code></pre> <p>This means your movies are located in <code>/mnt/movies_disk/media/movies</code> in your system and <code>/media/movies</code> inside Radarr container. </p> <p>Similary the TV Shows are in <code>/mnt/series_disk/media/tv</code> in your system and <code>/media/tv</code> inside Sonarr container.</p> <p>So, we can use this in Trailarr as:</p> <pre><code>services:\n  trailarr:\n    image: nandyalu/trailarr:latest\n    # Other options here\n    volumes:\n      - /docker/appdata/trailarr:/config\n      - /mnt/movies_disk/media/movies:/media/movies\n      - /mnt/series_disk/media/tv:/media/tv\n    # Other options here\n</code></pre> <p>Since <code>Radarr</code> and <code>Sonarr</code> have their media in different folders, we mapped both of them to Trailarr as is!</p> Example 3 - Different <code>Radarr</code> and <code>Sonarr</code> folders mapped to same container folder <p>If both your <code>Radarr</code> and <code>Sonarr</code> are mapped to same folder path on the right side like <code>/data</code> and you add them to <code>Trailarr</code> directly like below, we will have a problem (DO NOT DO THIS).</p> <pre><code># DO NOT USE THIS\nradarr:\n  # other config\n  volumes:\n    - /mnt/disk1/media/movies:/data\nsonarr:\n  # other config\n  volumes:\n    - /mnt/disk2/media/tv:/data\ntrailarr:\n  # other config\n  volumes:\n    - /mnt/disk1/media/movies:/data # &lt;-- DO NOT USE\n    - /mnt/disk2/media/tv:/data # &lt;-- DO NOT USE\n</code></pre> <p>Basically, what happens is Docker will map <code>/mnt/disk1/media/movies</code> to <code>/data</code> inside the container without any issues.</p> <p>But then it will try to map <code>/mnt/disk1/media/tv</code> to <code>/data</code> inside the container, which will override the first mapping.</p> <p>We don't know if Docker will map them in this order, so we cannot predict which one will be available inside Trailarr.</p> <p>So instead of mapping both to same internal folder <code>/data</code>, what we do is change them a little bit, but we need to remember these for configuring Path Mappings later!</p> <p>Here's an example of what we can do:</p> <pre><code># USE THIS INSTEAD\nradarr:\n  # other config\n  volumes:\n    - /mnt/disk1/media/movies:/data\nsonarr:\n  # other config\n  volumes:\n    - /mnt/disk2/media/tv:/data\ntrailarr:\n  # other config\n  volumes:\n    - /mnt/disk1/media/movies:/data/movies # &lt;-- MODIFIED\n    - /mnt/disk2/media/tv:/data/tv # &lt;-- MODIFIED\n</code></pre> Example 4 - Windows users <p>Let's go over a simple Windows configuration. Concepts form examples 1, 2 and 3 can also be applied to Windows as well, just change the left side of volume mapping with Windows path.</p> <p>Windows volume mappings are similar to Linux/MacOS volume mappings with one change, the left side of path is different!</p> <p>Windows paths use a '\\' (back-slash) and Linux/MacOS paths use '/' (forward-slash).</p> <p>When adding a volume mapping from Windows (Docker Desktop), you have some options, use the one that works for you:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use the original path as is</p> <pre><code>  volumes:\n    - C:\\Users\\nandyalu\\Videos\\Movies:/data/movies\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Use the original path with '\\' but instead of '\\' replace it with '\\\\'</p> <pre><code>  volumes:\n    - C:\\\\Users\\\\nandyalu\\\\Videos\\\\Movies:/data/movies\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Or replace '\\' with '/' by adding a '/' before the drive letter like this</p> <pre><code>  volumes:\n    - /C/Users/nandyalu/Videos/Movies:/data/movies\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>If you have network drives and the usual methods don't work, you can also try creating docker volumes for them as explained in the Network Drives section.</p> </li> <li>There might be other paths that work, if you know something else that has been working for you, feel free to keep using that! You can also share with us, so that we can add it here!</li> </ul> <p>Warning</p> <p>Trailarr Docker container uses <code>Ubuntu</code> OS, which is Linux, so we need to add Linux paths for right side paths in volume mapping.</p> <p>So, here's an example docker compose for Windows:</p> <pre><code>services:\n  trailarr:\n    # Other options here\n    volumes:\n      - trailarr_data:/config # Docker volume for appdata, the first part `trailarr_data` is the volume name\n      - M:\\Movies:/m/movies   # Movies drive\n      - R:\\TV:/r/tv           # TV series drive 1\n      - S:\\TV:/s/tv           # TV series drive 2\n      - T:\\TV:/t/tv           # TV series drive 3\n    restart: unless-stopped\n\nvolumes:\n  trailarr_data:  # volume name, should match the volume name in the service\n    # Any extra options for the volume if needed\n</code></pre> Example 5 - Non-Docker <code>Radarr</code> and <code>Sonarr</code> <p>There is nothing speciial here other than the fact that you have installed <code>Radarr</code> and <code>Sonarr</code> native apps and not as Docker containers. </p> <p>So, one thing that changes here is the fact that you don't have the right side path of volume mappings.</p> <p>Here's what you can do:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If all your media (Movies and TV Shows) are under one parent folder like <code>/mnt/disk1/media</code> with subfolders for <code>movies</code>, <code>tv</code>, then you can do this (recommended)</p> <pre><code>services:\n  trailarr:\n    # Other options here\n    volumes:\n      - /docker/appdata/trailarr:/config # appdata\n      - /mnt/disk1/media:/mnt/disk1/media # Media Folders, using same path\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    # Other options here\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>OR this</p> <pre><code>services:\n  trailarr:\n    # Other options here\n    volumes:\n      - /docker/appdata/trailarr:/config # appdata\n      - /mnt/disk1/media:/media # Media Folders, mapping to `/media` inside container\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    # Other options here\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>If your media is in different paths/disks then map each of them to a specific folder inside Trailarr. <code>/data</code>, <code>/media</code>, <code>/mnt</code>, <code>/storage</code> are all good choices. Just make sure you don't use a Linux system folder like <code>/app</code>, <code>/bin</code>, <code>/etc</code>, <code>/home</code>, <code>/var</code> etc.</p> <pre><code>services:\n  trailarr:\n    # Other options here\n    volumes:\n      - /docker/appdata/trailarr:/config # appdata\n      - /mnt/disk1/movies:/media/movies # Movies Folder\n      - /mnt/disk2/tv:/media/tv # TV Folder\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    # Other options here\n</code></pre> </li> </ul> <p>That's it!
